Simple emulator frontend using the backend of EmulationStation focused on simplicity and speed. Good for users with huge collections 

USAGE:

the application uses es_systems.cfg and gamelist.xml files like emulationstation
you need to locate you es_systems file on first run and the gamelist xmls and image folders need to be in the directory of your collections
see samples.txt for more information on the files used

to run a rom simply double click on it or press the enter button
you can use your keyboard for navigation as follows :

up-down = change game
left-right = change system
enter = run
comma-dot = change genre
escape = close
space - search

You can double click in a black area, and the joystick configuration window will show. 
Click on each command, press the button on the joystick and wait until the textbox fills.


you can also use the save function to create a script and simply double click on it and run the selected game

still a WIP obviously
