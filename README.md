Simple emulator frontend using the backend of EmulationStation

USAGE:

the application uses es_systems.cfg and gamelist.xml files like emulationstation
for now the location of es_systems.cfg is hardcoded and the gamelist xmls need to be in the directory of your collections
see samples.txt for more information on the files used

to run a rom simply double click on it

still a WIP obviously
