# VBEmu
Simple emulator frontend using the backend of EmulationStation focused on simplicity and speed. Good for users with huge collections 

USAGE:

the application uses es_systems.cfg and gamelist.xml files like emulationstation
you need to locate you es_systems file on first run and the gamelist xmls and image folders need to be in the directory of your collections
see samples.txt for more information on the files used

to run a rom simply double click on it

still a WIP obviously
