-------notes

if you run sselph's scraper in your rom folder without any arguments, the files will be automatically created as needed by this project
just use -mame for mame mode naming

you don't need to hardcode your rom folders, they will be detected automatically from the es_systems file. The only hardcoded address for now
is the location of the es_systems file
